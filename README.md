# Trongate Scaffold & Code Snippets

Would you like to code faster?  I know I certainly would! üëÄÔ∏è

A Visual Studio Code extension to compliment the Trongate ecosystem.   Consisting of the Trongate framework , Desktop-app and Nitro.  All tirelessly written by David Connelly, who I'd like to make special mention here for his continued dedication and commitment in keeping web development doors open to everyone.

### The One-V framework that will make PHP great again!

## Features

This extension will allow you to:

* Create a blank directory scaffold similar to the Desktop-app when creating a module.  Complete with asset.json and a starter class ready for you to create a module.

* Add PHP and custom Trongate code snippets to speed up your development.
